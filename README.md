# simon-css

This demonstrates the use of basic JavaScript for interactivity.

The addition of JavaScript makes our applicaiton completely functional.

The application has a login (home), game play, high scores, and about page. Each page contains a header that provides navigation between the pages, and a footer that references the source repository.

You can view this application running here: [Example Simon JavaScript](https://github.com/webprogramming260/simon-javascript)
